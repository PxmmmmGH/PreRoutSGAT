# PreRoutSGAT

This is the official open source repository for ....(ICCS)

# Baseline
The baseline of this work is [TimingGCN](https://github.com/TimingPredict/TimingPredict), and depends on some ideas of [PreRoutGNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00012) and [SGFormer](https://github.com/qitianwu/SGFormer)

# Usage
The dataset we use is same as TimingGCN, you can get the data from [TimingGCN Dataset](https://github.com/TimingPredict/Dataset).  

The structure of the code is roughly the same

Some specific problems for this work will be fixed in the future...
